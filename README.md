Code for Mastermind game and solver built for the game using Bayesian learning

This project includes the following files: 
Mastermind.py - contains the base game environment used for testing. This environment has the ability be played by an agent or by a human.

mmsolver.py - Contains a solver built for beating the game. This solver takes a list of all possible hypotheses, and as the game goes on, will being picking the best one as an action input.

Mastermind.ipynb - This file is a jupyter notebook that contains proper instructions and code for both of the above python files.
